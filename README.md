# Descriptive_analysisa:
# comprehensive analysis of the sales data with visualizations using Python, focusing on key insights from the dataset. 
#The analysis will include summary statistics, trends over time, sales by product category, customer demographics, and geographic distribution, with appropriate visualizations (line charts, bar plots, and pie charts). 
#I've used pandas for data processing and matplotlib/seaborn for plotting, ensuring the code is clear.
